# The Stock Exchange of Thailand Price Requests

This python code will get requests from SET (The Stock Exchange of Thailand) a real-time trading stock price in Thai Baht currency with an external link toward checking validity of the price using BS4 (Beautiful Soup 4) HTML scrapper.

# How Tos

This python code will get requests from [settrade.com](https://www.settrade.com/settrade/home) (The Stock Exchange of Thailand)
using beautiful soup 4 html scrapper.

1. Run the program
2. Input your preferred SET (The Stock Exchange of Thailand) ticker symbols
3. The program will return a real-time trading stock price with an external link toward checking validity of the price. 

# Note
This program cannot take a request when the website is in an on-going maintanance period (usually in the weekend of each month) since this code is relying on [settrade.com](https://www.settrade.com/settrade/home) data.

Any suggestion on my code are all welcome, I am here to share and improve myself.
